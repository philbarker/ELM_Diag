Unofficial attempt to diagram the [European Learning Model](https://github.com/european-commission-empl/European-Learning-Model) data model using [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) [Class diagram](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/classDiagram.html).

Starting point is the [ELM RDF Ontology](https://github.com/european-commission-empl/European-Learning-Model/tree/master/rdf/ontology) turtle representation. 

Starting by building diagram markdown by hand (but who knows, maybe a python script could automate it).
