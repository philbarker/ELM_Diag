Unofficial attempt to diagram the [European Learning Model](https://github.com/european-commission-empl/European-Learning-Model) data model using [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) [Class diagram](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/classDiagram.html).

Starting point is the [ELM RDF Ontology](https://github.com/european-commission-empl/European-Learning-Model/tree/master/rdf/ontology) turtle representation. 

turtle2mermaid.ipynb is a jupyter notebook that builds mermaid markdown for properties and relations where the domain and range are declared in the .ttl file; it also tries to identify the share properties from comments, but this relies on consistent marking of the comment lines (e.g. using `###` before a list of shared properties)â€”which is not always the case in the original ttl file.

I found it best to treat classification as a reference to Concepts as a characteristic rather than relationship as it reduces number of links very much.
